> This letter is the work of a number of anonymous contributors. 
> I have collected, and hosted, this letter in the hope of giving the growing majority
> of concerned users a venue to better communicate their concerns to the foundation board.
> Whether or not you agree, I ask that you take some time to read and consider their arguments,
> as I believe many of these voices are key to the future of the Nix and NixOS projects.
